# EasyGate1541-II

The EasyGate1541-II is also a replacement as a GateArray, similar to the [EasyGate1541](https://github.com/DL2DW/EasyGate1541). However, this version is designed for the Commodore 1541-II floppy drive.

I have currently implemented only the required routines for the 1541-**II**. Therefore this version cannot be used in the 1570 or 1571.

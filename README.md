# EasyGate1541-II

The EasyGate1541-II is also a replacement as a GateArray, similar to the [EasyGate1541](https://github.com/DL2DW/EasyGate1541). However, this version is designed for the Commodore 1541-II floppy drive.

I have currently implemented only the required routines for the 1541-**II**. Therefore this version cannot be used in the 1570 or 1571.



## Status

The code is ready so far, and works already in the 1541-II. 

Currently I am waiting for the first prototype boards. Unfortunately I had chosen FedEx as supplier this time. And they don't seem to want to leave China for over a week and finally deliver. According to tracking it could take another 2 weeks.

And no, it's not because of the Chinese New Year, because later shipped boards with EuroPacket have already been delivered.

Well, there you pay once more and get once again significantly less... :-) 



I have been asked several times now if I would extend the code for the 1571. Theoretically this is possible, but practically I don't have a 1571, so I can neither test it nor make any adjustments.
